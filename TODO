Cobo game:

Cobo is a card game. Each player is dealt 4 cards in a square.
Each player look 2 of the 4 cards.

13 different cards, 1 to 13 (jack, queen, king 11 to 13) + 1 0 card (1 eyed king)

If a player has less than 5 points (sum of their cards), they can CABO.
A last round is played. The player with the fewest points win.

If a player has no card left -> Auto-CABO.


Round:

A player can take a card either in the draw or discard pile.
They can swap it from a card of their hand (without looking at it)
or discard it directly in the discard card (potential special effect).

7 - 8: know your fate
9 - 10: know a friend
Jack - Queen: Switch between


Whenever a card on the discard pile matches any of the cards on table, any player can tap te discard pile. The first player to do so has to discard at least 1 matching card. However the card can come from any player's cards. Whenever a player discards a card from another player, they can place one of their own cards where the discarded card was. When a player tries to discard a non-matching card, they has to put it back, and draw a blind card and add it to their own cards.
